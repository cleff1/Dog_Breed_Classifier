# Dog_Breed_Classifier
## Project Overview
The aim of this project was to build a pipeline to process images and identify the breed of dog, if it was given an image of a dog. If the image was of a human the response would identify the dog breed which the human most resembles.

This project was presented and completed as part of the capstone project in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.
